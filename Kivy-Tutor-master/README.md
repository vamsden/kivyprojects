Kivy Tutor
==========
Program I made for my [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVL05_-Bmok&index=1&list=PL3kg5TcOuFlqHsEtDKneH56oHypWdHXwj).
It basically allows anyone to practice simple arithmetic.
Allows for basics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and mix.

TODO
====
Things that people might want to add to practice Kivy programming

- Allow multi language
- Track Progress
- Ads?
- Check that the upper limit is always higher than the lower limit.
- Maybe some animations instead of a boring popup?
